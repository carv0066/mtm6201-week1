        <p>My name is Carlos Jeffrey Carvajal Rodriguez, I’m a 22-year-old student from Colombia specifically from San Andres Island, this part of Colombia where I’m from some people also speak a creole language but I can only understand it a little bit, not speak it myself.</p>
        <p>I’ve been in Canada for 2 years continuously since April of 2021, I first arrived at Vancouver and then on December of 2022 I moved to Ottawa to be able to enter the program I am at right now in Algonquin College. I plan to graduate from the program and ideally become a Web developer with the skills I’ll be learning on the future semesters and be able to work from home one day.</p>
